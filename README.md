## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy a **highly available, scalable, and secure WordPress website** on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** with **Amazon RDS** for database management. This setup leverages **Terraform** for automation, ensuring that AWS best practices for security, scalability, and performance are followed. The architecture is designed to handle high traffic loads using a multi-AZ (Availability Zone) configuration for fault tolerance.

## AWS Architecture Breakdown
- **Elastic Beanstalk**: Manages infrastructure provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and monitoring for the WordPress environment.
- **Amazon RDS**: Provides a highly available MySQL database with data redundancy in multiple availability zones.
- **Amazon S3**: Hosts static files and media uploads.
- **CloudWatch**: Monitors performance metrics such as CPU utilization and application health.
- **IAM Roles**: Implements the principle of least privilege to restrict permissions.

## Prerequisites
1. **AWS Account** with appropriate IAM permissions.
2. **AWS CLI** installed and configured.
3. **Terraform** installed on your local machine.

## Step 1: Manual Setup on AWS

### IAM Role Creation
1. **Create the Elastic Beanstalk Service Role**:
   - Navigate to the **IAM Console**, create a new role for **Elastic Beanstalk**.
   - Attach the `AWSElasticBeanstalkServiceRolePolicy`.
   - Name it `aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role`.

2. **Create the EC2 Instance Role**:
   - Create another role for **EC2** and attach `AmazonS3FullAccess` and `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy`.
   - Name it `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`.

### Elastic Beanstalk Setup
1. **Create Application**:  
   - Go to **Elastic Beanstalk** in the AWS Console.
   - Create a new application named `wordpress-app` and select **PHP** as the platform.
   - Upload the **WordPress** `.zip` file (download and compress it from the official WordPress website).

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up an environment as a **Web server environment**.
   - Select **t3.micro** for the instance type.
   - Use **multi-AZ** for high availability (note that multi-AZ incurs additional costs).
   - Assign the IAM roles created earlier (`aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role` and `aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role`).

3. **Deploy the Application**:  
   - Follow the Elastic Beanstalk wizard to complete the deployment.
   - Once complete, you should see the WordPress installation page.

### Amazon RDS Setup
1. **Create RDS MySQL Database**:  
   - Navigate to the **RDS Console** and create a MySQL instance.
   - Select **multi-AZ** deployment for high availability.
   - Use the **db.t3.micro** instance type and enable automatic backups.

2. **Connect WordPress to RDS**:  
   - Update the `wp-config.php` file in your WordPress deployment with the RDS endpoint and credentials.

## Step 2: Automate with Terraform

### Setup Instructions
1. Create a new directory for the project and initialize Terraform.

   ```bash
   mkdir aws-wordpress-terraform
   cd aws-wordpress-terraform
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Download the Terraform Configuration**:
   - The Terraform configuration files have been uploaded separately.

3. **Run Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   This command will automatically provision the entire infrastructure on AWS, including Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, IAM roles, and associated configurations.

### Using Variables for Configuration
To enhance flexibility and security, variables have been used for Terraform configurations. Hereâ€™s an example of how to declare and use variables in the `main.tf`:

```hcl
variable "region" {
  description = "AWS region"
  default     = "us-west-2"
}

variable "db_password" {
  description = "The database password"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

Make sure to refer to the `terraform.tfvars` file to pass the actual values for these variables:

```hcl
db_password = "your_secure_password"
```

## Security Best Practices

### Data Encryption
1. **Use AWS KMS**: Implement AWS Key Management Service for encryption of sensitive data, including RDS credentials and S3 objects.
2. **Enable SSL**: Configure SSL connections for data-in-transit between WordPress and RDS.

### Access Management
1. **Enable MFA**: Use Multi-Factor Authentication for secure access to AWS accounts.
2. **Implement Least Privilege**: Apply the least privilege principle to IAM roles, ensuring that users and services have only the permissions they need.

### Monitoring and Logging
1. **Utilize CloudWatch**: Set up CloudWatch for monitoring application health, performance metrics, and triggering alarms for unusual activities.
2. **Enable CloudTrail**: Use AWS CloudTrail to log all API calls, enhancing visibility and compliance.

---

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting
1. **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure that the RDS instance is in the same VPC as the Elastic Beanstalk environment and that the security groups allow traffic on the necessary ports.
2. **Deployment Timeout**: If the Elastic Beanstalk deployment times out, check the logs in the AWS console for any application errors or resource limits.
3. **Insufficient Permissions**: Double-check IAM roles and policies to ensure that all necessary permissions are granted.

---

## Cleanup
To avoid incurring charges, ensure that all AWS resources are deleted after testing. For manual cleanup, delete the Elastic Beanstalk environment, terminate the RDS instance, and remove any S3 buckets.

For Terraform cleanup, simply run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Conclusion
This guide outlines the process of deploying a **secure and scalable WordPress website** on AWS, leveraging both manual setup and Terraform automation. By adhering to AWS best practices, this project showcases expertise in cloud architecture, security, and automation, making it an excellent resource for developers and cloud professionals.
